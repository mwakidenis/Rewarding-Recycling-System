3. Go to the Console tab
4. Try to submit a report
5. Look for any error messages or validation logs

**Description**: 10-500 characters  
- ✅ Good: "There is a large amount of plastic waste dumped near the playground area"
- ❌ Bad: "Waste here" (too short)

**Location**: Valid coordinates

### 6. Debug Information

The form now includes debug logging. Check the browser console for:
- `🔍 Validating form data:` - Shows what data is being validated
- `🔍 Validation errors:` - Shows any frontend validation errors
- `📝 Sending report data:` - Shows what data is being sent to server
- `❌ Report submission error:` - Shows any server errors

### 7. Test with Different Data

Try these exact values to test:

```json
{
  "title": "Plastic Waste in Central Park",
  "description": "Large amount of plastic bottles and bags scattered around the playground area near the fountain",
  "location": {
    "lat": 40.7829,
    "lng": -73.9654
  },
  "imageUrl": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1558618047-3c8c76ca7d13?w=500"
}
```

### 8. Check Server Logs

If you're running the server in terminal, check for:
- `📝 Received report data:` - Shows what the server received
- Any error messages

### 9. Reset and Try Again

If nothing works:
1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Restart the development servers
3. Try with a fresh browser session
4. Check if MongoDB is running

## Still Having Issues?

If you're still getting validation errors:

1. **Copy the exact error message** from the console
2. **Check what data** is being sent (look for the debug logs)
3. **Verify all fields** meet the requirements above
4. **Try the exact test data** provided above

The validation is working correctly - the issue is likely with the data being submitted not meeting the requirements.
